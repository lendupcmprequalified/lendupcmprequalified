If you spend more than you earn on a regular basis, it is a bad practice. To overcome this situation, if you opt for a payday loan, it will be a “risky solution”. Payday loan companies often take the advantages of your need and lead you in debt trap.

The most obvious disadvantage of payday loan is High cost. The APR of payday loan varies between 400% to 800%. Think about your investments even on a high interest stock, you can get an annual return of 20% to 30% for investment on a stock although investments on stocks are considered as “high risk”.

So, consider about all the possible alternative ways before opting for a payday loan cash advance.

•Payday loan borrowing situation arises due to bad financial planning. I suggest you to prepare a realistic budget at the beginning of each month in order to keep the balance between your earnings and spending. Avoid unnecessary purchases. Also save some money each and every month. Your savings will be counted at the time of crisis. Consider taking help from a consumer credit counseling bureau.
